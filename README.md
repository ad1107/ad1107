 - **ad1107 - who decided to return to GitHub for curating boredom.**
 - **You might know me by some of my other handles/nicknames, though.**

## Why am I here?

- This is a place for me to mindstorm and (sometimes) actually doing some light, simple projects, mostly for killing time, (and for curbing game addiction, hopefully)
- Focusing on automation tools, Python ideas, and preparing for getting knowledge about web.
- Currently not into [Competitive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming), unfortunately.
- I may be inactive for unspecified amount of time when I'm busy.
