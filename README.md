# *Greetings!*

 - **ad1107 - who decided to choose GitHub for curating boredom.**
 - **You might know me by some of my other names as well**

## Why am I here?

- A ~~cage~~ room for random ideas that pop in my mind once a month (at best)
- Automated tools, interesting scripts, and everything in between to cure my boredom.
- Active/Inactive for unspecified amount of time. This is not my work platform right now.

- Invite me to any organization if you're familiar with me for a while ðŸ¥º
