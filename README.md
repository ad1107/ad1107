# Hi there!

 - **I'm ad1107, who decided to return to GitHub for curating boredom.**
 - **You might know me by some of my other handles/nicknames, though.**

## Why I am here?

- This is a place for me to mindstorm and (sometimes) actually doing some light, simple projects, mostly for killing time, (and for curbing game addiction, hopefully)
- Focusing on automation tools, Python ideas, and preparing for getting knowledge about web.
- Currently not into [Competitive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming), unfortunately.
- I may be inactive for unspecified amount of time when I'm busy.

*Fun fact*: *I'm learning how to properly making and managing projects from the beginning, so if I'm doing something wrong, feel free to provide guidance or suggestions!*

## Contributions?
- Just follow the license that goes along with it.
- In most of my repositories, you can freely use it (without distributing it as closed-source)
- Contact me if you want to be the collaborators of any repository.

## Contact:
- Discord: `@ad1107`
- I will add some more ways in the future.
